Introduction!

Deployment of Voice-over IP (VoIP) and other real-time streaming applications has been somewhat limited in wireless LANs today, partially because of the high handoff latencies and severe transmission loss experienced by mobile users. Our goal in this work is to eliminate handoff latency and to minimize the data loss during switch by exploiting the potential of multiple radios in Wi-Fi devices. In our work, a handover scheme called Hoolock has been developed. It is essentially a NOX-based mobility manager that realizes seamless mobile handoff over Open-Flow enabled Wi-Fi networks.
